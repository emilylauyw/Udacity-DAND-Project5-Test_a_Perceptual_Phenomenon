    "#### Introduction\n",
    "Stroop effect is a demonstration of interference in the reaction time of a task. In this experiment, we will look at some data collected from people who have performed the task and will compute some statistics describing the results. \n",
    "\n",
    "The task has two conditions: a congruent words condition, and an incongruent words condition. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Congruent Words Condition - the words being displayed are color words whose names match the colors in which they are printed: for example RED, BLUE. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Incongruent Words Condition - the words displayed are color words whose names do not match the colors in which they are printed: for example PURPLE, ORANGE. \n",
    "\n",
    "In both the case, the time duration of the person takes to read all the words in equally sized lists is measured. "
